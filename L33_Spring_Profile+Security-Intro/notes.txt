1. application-staging.properties - debug - 1K requests per day - 2~3 debug logs
   datasource.url = db2        -- db2 is less performant and cheap so that you can save cost


2. application-prod.properties - info / warn       - 10 M requests per day
   datasource.url = db1        -- db1 is more performant / reliable and scalable

datasource.url = db1

If debug logging level is enabled on production, I would 20M~30M extra logs => more logs files
